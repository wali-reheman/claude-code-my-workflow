# Plan-First Workflow & Context Preservation

**These rules apply to ALL tasks, regardless of file type.**

---

## Rule 1: Plan Before You Build

**For any non-trivial task, enter Plan Mode FIRST before writing code or making edits.**

A task is "non-trivial" if it involves:
- Creating or modifying more than one file
- Implementing a new feature or workflow
- Translating between formats (e.g., Stata to R)
- Any task the user describes with multiple steps
- Any task where the approach is not immediately obvious

### The Plan-First Protocol

1. **Enter Plan Mode** — use `EnterPlanMode` to switch to planning
1.5. **Check institutional memory** — read `./PROJECT_MEMORY.md` for any `[LEARN]` entries relevant to this task
2. **Draft the plan** — outline what will change, which files are affected, and in what order
3. **Present to user** — explain the plan and wait for approval
4. **Only after approval** — exit plan mode
5. **IMMEDIATELY save the plan to disk** — use the Write tool to save to `quality_reports/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md` (see Rule 2). This is the **first thing you do after exiting plan mode**, before any implementation work. Claude's built-in plan file is ephemeral and will be lost; the disk copy is what survives.
6. **Save initial session log** — capture the goal, plan summary, and key context while it's fresh (see Rule 5)
7. **Implement via orchestrator** — the orchestrator protocol takes over (see `orchestrator-protocol.md`): implement → verify → review → fix → score → present results

> **Why step 5 matters:** In plan mode, Claude cannot use Write/Edit tools — so you cannot save the plan during planning. The moment you exit plan mode, save the plan FIRST. If you skip this step and start implementing, auto-compression may discard the plan from context before you get a chance to save it.

### What a Good Plan Includes

- **Task description** — what are we trying to accomplish?
- **Files to modify** — which files will be created, edited, or deleted?
- **Approach** — step-by-step implementation strategy
- **Dependencies** — what must happen before what?
- **Verification steps** — how will we confirm it worked?
- **Risks** — what could go wrong?

### When to Skip Planning

You may skip plan mode for:
- Single-file edits with a clear scope (fix a typo, add a citation)
- Running existing skills/commands (`/review-r`, `/proofread`)
- Purely informational questions
- Tasks the user explicitly says to do immediately

---

## Rule 2: Save Plans to Disk

**Every plan must be saved to a file so it survives context compression. This is NOT optional — Claude's internal plan file is ephemeral and will be lost. The disk copy at `quality_reports/plans/` is the only reliable record.**

> **CRITICAL: Use the Write tool to save plans immediately after exiting plan mode.** Claude's built-in plan mode writes to a temporary file that is not persisted. You MUST write a separate copy to `quality_reports/plans/` yourself.

### Where to Save

```
quality_reports/plans/
├── 2026-02-06_draft-methods-section.md
├── 2026-02-06_merge-vdem-polity.md
└── ...
```

### Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD_short-description.md`

### Plan File Format

```markdown
# Plan: [Short Description]

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Status:** DRAFT | APPROVED | IN PROGRESS | COMPLETED
**Task:** [What the user asked for]

## Approach

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. ...

## Files to Modify

- `path/to/file1.ext` — [what changes]
- `path/to/file2.ext` — [what changes]

## Verification

- [ ] [How to verify step 1]
- [ ] [How to verify step 2]

## Notes

[Any risks, open questions, or decisions made]
```

### When to Update the Plan

- **Before starting:** Status = APPROVED
- **During implementation:** Check off completed steps
- **After completion:** Status = COMPLETED, add any deviations noted
- **If the plan changes:** Update the file and note what changed and why

---

## Rule 3: Never /clear — Rely on Auto-Compression

**NEVER use `/clear` to reset the conversation. Use auto-compression instead.**

### Why This Matters

- `/clear` is a **nuclear option** — it destroys ALL context, including design decisions, corrections, and the mental model of the project
- Auto-compression is **graceful degradation** — Claude Code's built-in compression preserves the most important context while freeing space
- Saved plans (Rule 2) provide a **safety net** — even if compression loses details, the plan file on disk has the full strategy

### What to Do When Context Gets Long

1. **Let auto-compression handle it.** Claude Code will compress automatically when needed.
2. **Save important context to disk** — plans, decisions, correction logs
3. **Reference saved files** — point Claude to the plan file or quality report if context seems thin
4. **Start a new session if truly needed** — but start by reading the saved plan and recent git log, not from a blank slate

### Session Recovery Protocol

If starting a new session (or after heavy compression):

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for project context
2. Read the most recent plan in `quality_reports/plans/`
3. Check `git log --oneline -10` for recent changes
4. Check `git diff` for any uncommitted work
5. State what you understand the current task to be

## Rule 4: Continuous Learning with [LEARN] Tags

**When a mistake is corrected, immediately append a `[LEARN:tag]` entry to `./PROJECT_MEMORY.md` (the file in the repo root).**

> **CRITICAL: Use the Edit tool to append to `./PROJECT_MEMORY.md` in the repository root.** Do NOT use Claude's built-in `/memory` system or write to `~/.claude/projects/`. The project keeps its own memory file so the user can see and version-control it. The file is named `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` (not `MEMORY.md`) specifically to avoid collision with Claude's native memory system.

Format: `[LEARN:category] Incorrect assumption → correct fact`

Common categories: `notation`, `citation`, `r-code`, `workflow`, `latex`. Add a tag whenever the user corrects a factual claim, a compilation error reveals a wrong assumption, or a review agent catches a systematic error. These persist across sessions and prevent repeating the same mistake.

**At session start, always read `./PROJECT_MEMORY.md`** to load past corrections before beginning work.

---

## Rule 5: Session Logging

**Session logs live at `quality_reports/session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`.** They are a running record of *why* things happened — not what changed (git handles that).

There are **three distinct logging behaviors:**

### 5a. Post-Plan Log (special trigger)

**Immediately after a plan is approved**, create the session log file with:
- The goal and plan summary
- Key context and constraints discussed during planning
- Rationale for the chosen approach, including rejected alternatives

This is a specific, predictable trigger: plan approved → save log. It captures decisions while context is richest, before implementation eats up the context window.

### 5b. Incremental Logging (during implementation)

**As you work, append to the session log whenever something worth remembering happens:**
- A design decision is made or changed mid-implementation
- An unexpected problem is discovered and solved
- The user expresses a preference or corrects an assumption
- A review agent catches something significant
- The approach deviates from the original plan

This is the most important behavior. Context gets compressed as the session progresses. If a key decision lives only in the conversation, it will be lost. Writing it to the log file immediately makes it permanent.

**Do not batch these updates.** Append a 1-3 line entry as soon as the event happens.

### 5c. End-of-Session Log (closing trigger)

**When the session is ending**, add a final section to the log with:
- Summary of what was accomplished
- Open questions for next session
- Any unresolved issues

Trigger: end-of-session signals ("let's wrap up", "commit this", "we're done").

**Do not wait to be asked for any of these.** All three behaviors are proactive.
