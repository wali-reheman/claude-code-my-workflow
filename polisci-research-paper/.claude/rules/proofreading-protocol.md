# Proofreading Agent Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Every manuscript file MUST be reviewed by the proofreading agent before any commit or PR.**

The proofreading agent checks for:
- **Grammar errors** -- subject-verb agreement, missing articles, wrong prepositions
- **Typos** -- misspellings, search-and-replace corruption
- **Consistency** -- notation, citation style (`\citet` vs `\citep`), terminology
- **Academic writing quality** -- informal abbreviations, missing words, awkward phrasing
- **Section transitions** -- logical flow between paragraphs and sections

## Two-Phase Workflow: PROPOSE FIRST, THEN DEPLOY

**The agent must NEVER apply changes directly. It must first propose all changes for review.**

### Phase 1: Review & Propose (NO EDITS)

Launch parallel review agents for all modified manuscript files. Each agent:

1. Reads the entire file carefully
2. Identifies all grammar, typo, overflow, and consistency issues
3. Produces a **detailed report** listing every proposed change with:
   - Line number or section context
   - Current text (what's wrong)
   - Proposed fix (what it should be)
   - Category (grammar / typo / overflow / consistency)
4. Saves the report to `quality_reports/` (e.g., `quality_reports/paper_name_report.md`)
5. **Does NOT modify any source files**

**Example report entry:**
```
### Issue 7: Wrong preposition
- **File:** Manuscripts/paper_name/main.tex
- **Location:** Section 3.2, line ~247
- **Current:** "eligible to the program"
- **Proposed:** "eligible for the program"
- **Category:** Grammar
```

### Phase 2: Review & Approve

The user (or Claude, if instructed) reviews the proposed changes:
- Accepts all changes, or
- Accepts selectively, or
- Requests modifications

**Only after explicit approval** does the agent proceed to apply fixes.

### Phase 3: Apply Fixes

Launch parallel fix agents to apply only the approved changes:
- Each agent reads the report and applies edits using the Edit tool
- Uses `replace_all: true` for issues with multiple instances
- Verifies each edit succeeded
- Reports completion summary

## Agent Prompt Template

```
You are an expert proofreading agent for academic manuscripts. Review the file
[FILENAME] thoroughly for:

1. GRAMMAR: Subject-verb agreement, articles (a/an/the), prepositions, tense consistency
2. TYPOS: Misspellings, search-and-replace artifacts, duplicated words
3. OVERFLOW: Overfull hbox warnings (LaTeX)
4. CONSISTENCY: Citation format, notation, terminology across sections
5. ACADEMIC QUALITY: Informal language, missing words, awkward constructions

IMPORTANT: Do NOT edit any files. Only produce a report listing all findings with:
- Location (line number or section title)
- Current text
- Proposed fix
- Category

Save the report to quality_reports/[FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXT]_report.md
```

## Integration Points

Run proofreading at these points:
1. **Before any commit** -- on all modified manuscript files
2. **Before any PR** -- full sweep of all manuscript files
3. **After creating new manuscript content** -- immediately after drafting
4. **After bulk edits** -- any search-and-replace or refactoring

## Quality Reports

Reports saved to `quality_reports/` with naming convention:
```
quality_reports/
├── paper_name_report.md
├── paper_name_appendix_report.md
└── ...
```

These are **auto-generated** and serve as an audit trail of quality checks.
