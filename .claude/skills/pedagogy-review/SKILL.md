# Pedagogical Review of Lecture Slides

Perform a comprehensive pedagogical review.

## Steps

1. **Identify the file** specified in `$ARGUMENTS`
   - If no argument, ask user which lecture to review
   - If just a name, look in `Quarto/` or `Slides/`

2. **Launch the pedagogy-reviewer agent** with the full file path
   - The agent checks 13 pedagogical patterns
   - Performs deck-level analysis (narrative arc, pacing, visual rhythm, notation)
   - Considers student perspective (prerequisites, objections)

3. **The agent produces a report** saved to:
   `quality_reports/[FILENAME_WITHOUT_EXT]_pedagogy_report.md`

4. **Present summary to user:**
   - Patterns followed vs violated (out of 13)
   - Deck-level assessments
   - Critical recommendations (top 3-5)

## Important Notes

- This is a **read-only review** — no files are edited
- Focuses on **pedagogy** not visual layout (use `/visual-audit` for that)
- For a combined review, use `/slide-excellence` instead
